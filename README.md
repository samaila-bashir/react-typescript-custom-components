# React Custom Components with TypeScript

This README outlines the custom components I've developed in a personal React project, leveraging TypeScript to enhance flexibility, type safety, and usability.

## Building a More Dynamic & Flexible Component

I started by creating a more dynamic and flexible component using TypeScript's type system to handle different props combinations and variations in component behavior.

## Flexible Components With Required Prop Combinations

Next, I ensured that the components accept required prop combinations to enforce better usage patterns and prevent runtime errors.

## Building Components with Discriminated Unions

I utilized discriminated unions in TypeScript to build components that can switch behavior based on specific prop values, enhancing component versatility.

## Building a Basic Wrapper Component

I demonstrated building a basic wrapper component to encapsulate common UI patterns and simplify component composition.

## Building Better Wrapper Components with ComponentPropsWithoutRef

By leveraging `ComponentPropsWithoutRef`, I enhanced wrapper components to accept additional props while preserving type safety.

## Building a Wrapper Component That Renders Different Elements

I explored creating wrapper components capable of rendering different underlying elements based on provided props, improving component reusability.

## Working with Type Predicates & Facing TypeScript Limitations

I utilized type predicates to refine types and handle complex scenarios where TypeScript's static analysis may encounter limitations.

## Building a Basic Polymorphic Component

I introduced the concept of polymorphic components and demonstrated how to create them using TypeScript for enhanced flexibility.

## Building a Better Polymorphic Component with Generics

I advanced the polymorphic component by leveraging TypeScript generics to provide even more flexibility and type safety.

## Using forwardRef with TypeScript

I explored using `forwardRef` in conjunction with TypeScript to create components that support ref forwarding, enabling more advanced usage scenarios.

## Building Another Wrapper Component (Custom Form Component)

I extended the wrapper component concept to create a custom form component, showcasing how to encapsulate complex form logic in a reusable manner.

## Sharing Logic with "unknown" & Type Casting

I discussed sharing logic between components using the `unknown` type and type casting techniques, ensuring type safety while maintaining flexibility.

## Exposing Component APIs with useImperativeHandle (with TypeScript)

Finally, I demonstrated exposing component APIs using `useImperativeHandle` and TypeScript to provide a clear and type-safe interface for interacting with components programmatically.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This script runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
